![Language Nix](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-Nix-7e7eff)

I'm a software developer specializing in containerization and distributed systems.  I primarily program in [Go](https://go.dev), but I do quite a lot of frontend work with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) alongside [React](https://react.dev/) or [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

When it comes to infrastructure, I work a lot with [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) (and even sometimes with Kubernetes running on NixOS).
